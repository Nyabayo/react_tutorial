# Door Toggle App

## What This App Does
This app lets you **open and close a virtual door** by clicking a button.

✅ If the door is CLOSED, it opens.  
✅ If the door is OPEN, it closes.  
✅ The button changes color: **Green for open, Red for closed**.  

## What is a Click Event?
A **click event** happens when you **press a button** with your mouse.  

Imagine a real door. When you **push** it, the door **opens**. When you **pull** it, the door **closes**.  
This app does the same thing!

## How It Works
1. We have a **button** that listens for clicks.
2. Each time you click, the door toggles between OPEN and CLOSED.
3. The text and button color change based on the door’s state.

## How to Run This App
1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
2. Open a terminal and type:
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app door-toggle-app

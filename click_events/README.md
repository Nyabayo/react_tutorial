# Light Switch App

## What This App Does
This app lets you **turn a virtual light ON and OFF** by clicking a button.  

When you click the button:  
✅ If the light is OFF, it turns ON.  
✅ If the light is ON, it turns OFF.  

## What is a Click Event?
A **click event** is when you **press a button** with your mouse.  

Imagine a real switch at home. If you press it **ON**, the light glows. If you press it **OFF**, the light turns dark. This app does the same thing!

## How It Works
1. We have a **button** that listens when you click it.
2. Each time you click, the light switches between ON and OFF.
3. The text **changes** to show if the light is ON or OFF.
4. The button color changes to **yellow** when ON and **gray** when OFF.

## How to Run This App
1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
2. Open a terminal and type:
   ```sh
   npm create vite@latest
